# TinkerPal - [tinkerpal.co](https://tinkerpal.co)

**TinkerPal** is a community-driven web app designed to connect everyday people with local, reliable helpers for manual tasks.

Whether you need help assembling furniture, fixing a leaky pipe, moving a couch, or hanging a shelf — TinkerPal makes it easy to **find trustworthy, nearby people who can get the job done**.

TinkerPal isn't just about getting tasks done — it's about creating a helpful, trust-based community. Every user can both post tasks and offer to complete them, creating an environment where skills and time can be exchanged with ease.

## Reputation system

At the heart of TinkerPal is a reputation system that rewards helpfulness and reliability:
- Tinkers build their reputation by completing tasks and receiving reviews.
- Posters can make more informed decisions by viewing profiles and past ratings.

Your profile becomes your portfolio — **the more you help, the more trusted you become.**

## Make money on the side

TinkerPal isn't just for getting help — it's also a simple way to earn some extra cash by offering your time and skills. 

If you’re handy, have free time on weekends, or just enjoy helping people out, you can pick up small local tasks and get paid for your work.

Whether you're a student, a freelancer, or someone looking to hustle on the side, TinkerPal gives you direct access to real-world gigs in your area.

## Use cases

- Need a hand moving some boxes?
- Don’t have the tools to install that new shelf?
- Want someone to mow your lawn or shovel snow?

Just post a task, and someone from the TinkerPal might pick it up!

## Built While Learning Rails

I've been interested in Ruby and Ruby on Rails for a while, so I decided to give it a go and build this project to see what it’s all about.
